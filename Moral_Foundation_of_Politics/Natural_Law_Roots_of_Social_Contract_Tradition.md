Certainty and Science: 

__Sources of Individual Rights:__

Workmanship: we are equally God's property 
- Ownership: God gave the world to mankind 
in common 
- Equal Access to God’s Word 
- Sovereign individuals (The INDIVIDUAL right to resist)

- Workmanship's knowledge

__Social Contract__

- origin of society
- legitimacy of the authority of the state over the individual.

__Natural Rights__

- rights that not contingent upon the laws, customs, or beliefs of any particular culture or government, and therefore universal and inalienable.
- legal rights are those bestowed onto a person by a given legal system

Locke believed that natural rights were inalienable, and that the rule of God therefore superseded government authority;

According to Locke there are three natural rights:
- Estate: everyone is entitled to own all they create or gain through gift or trade so long as it doesn't conflict with the first two rights.
- Liberty: everyone is entitled to do anything they want to so long as it doesn't conflict with the first right.
- Life: everyone is entitled to live once they are created.

The Lockean concept of the social contract was invoked in the United States Declaration of Independence.

This provides the foundation for utilitarianism, Hegelianism, and Marxism in 19th Century.
